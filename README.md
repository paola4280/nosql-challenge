# nosql-challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to work with NoSQL databases, specifically, MongoDB. 
For this, we worked with a UK Food database that provided some of the ratings data 
to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
Some activities included setting up the database, updating it, and analyzing it. 

I found the assignment challenging especially because I have one answer with a 
0 result for the table, which I don't think it right not right. I tried looking for alternative code solutions, but my internet has not been
cooperating for the past 6 days, so I had to submit it like that. 

For help and debugging I used mostly my notebook notes and ChatGpt notes.
